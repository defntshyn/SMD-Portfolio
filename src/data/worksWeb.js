The goal of the project was to digitize the manual process of handling reservations and billing. We started by gathering requirements, planning what features should be included, and finalizing the contents of the system. Once everything was outlined, I took the lead in designing the system interface using Figma, carefully selecting the right colors, fonts, and layouts to ensure clarity and usability.", "After several revisions and feedback sessions, we finalized the design and moved into development. My main role in this project was to handle the front-end design and implementation of the system. It was developed using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and we collaborated through GitHub for version control and efficiency. This project gave me valuable hands-on experience in both UI design and actual implementation, as well as teamwork and project management in a larger-scale academic project."],

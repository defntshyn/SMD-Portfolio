        description: ["Aria was the product idea we developed for our Business Process Management subject. It’s a headphone-shaped portable fan that rests on the neck, designed with built-in wireless earbuds for dual use. For this project, I created the prototype of the mobile application using Canva, which was intended to act as the product’s remote and monitoring app. Through the design, users can Monitor the battery percentage of both the fan and earbuds,Adjust the fan speed directly from the app, and Control the earbud volume and settings. This was one of my first projects where I connected a physical product idea with a digital interface. My goal was to make the design simple and easy to visualize, so even if it’s only a prototype, it could clearly show how the product and app would work together."],

        description: ["This UI design was created during my internship, as requested by my supervisor, to serve as a visual prototype for an e-barangay system. The primary requirement was to design a dashboard that would help the barangay staff visualize how the system could look and function. I began by selecting a color palette and typography suitable for formal government use, and I used San Miguel as a sample barangay for clearer visualization. Initially, I designed the login page and dashboard, but after review, my supervisor also requested an example of how transaction interfaces and printed documents might appear. I expanded the design to include these additional elements, resulting in a more complete and functional system mock-up. This task helped me practice balancing user-friendliness with a professional interface."],

We used Figma for the layout and Canva for extra elements. We worked together, exchanged ideas, and revised the design several times based on feedback from our supervisor. When the final design was approved, I implemented it using WordPress. This was one of my first real experiences seeing a design go from prototype to an actual working website, which made me appreciate both design and development sides of the process."],

I designed the UI using Figma, highlighting the core features of a POS system such as order management, sales tracking, and receipt generation.

I kept the design simple and clean, focusing on presenting the items clearly while also making the interface visually appealing.

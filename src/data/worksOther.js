Some of these works were made for school projects, while others were done as a personal hobby. Designing for different occasions allows me to explore layouts, typography, and color combinations while adding a personal creative touch. This practice also helps me strengthen my visual communication skills and adaptability in different design contexts."],

Through these, I was able to explore the basics of modeling objects and structures in a digital environment. One of my notable projects is also included in this section, where I applied the concepts I learned to build a more complete 3D output. While 3D modeling is not my primary focus, working on these projects gave me an appreciation of the process and helped me broaden my design skills."],

The system consisted of different records such as students, faculty, and courses, with the main highlight being the management of student grades. It was designed to provide an organized way of recording and retrieving data efficiently.", "For the design of the forms, I explored different references online to gather inspiration and also used Canva for additional elements. I then combined and overlaid these elements to create a more polished interface inside MS Access. The system also featured queries for searching and filtering records, as well as a print function for generating student grade reports and other records. Through this project, I gained a deeper understanding of relational databases, queries, and form design in MS Access."],

It was designed to help users manage and organize library resources in a more structured and digital way.", "In addition to managing records, the system also featured queries for searching and filtering data, as well as a login system for different users to ensure security and access control. This project allowed me to apply database concepts alongside programming in VB, which gave me valuable experience in creating a more functional, user-driven system. It also helped me practice both the technical and logical aspects of system design, from structuring tables and queries to building forms and implementing user authentication."],
